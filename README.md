# Language-Model

A Language Model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given any sequence of words of length m, a language model assigns a probability P to the whole sequence. Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages.

Language Model which refers to advanced AI models like GPT-3.5 developed by OpenAI. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to learn patterns, context, and language structures. They can be used for various applications such as natural language processing, chatbots, language translation, text generation, and more. LLMs have the ability to understand and respond to complex queries, provide detailed information, and engage in conversations across a wide range of topics.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced machine learning models trained on massive amounts of text data. These models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, are designed to understand and generate human-like text. This repository serves as a playground for exploring the capabilities of LLMs and experimenting with various NLP tasks.

## Features

- **Text Generation:** Utilize LLMs to generate coherent and contextually relevant text passages.

- **Text Completion:** Use LLMs to complete sentences or prompts, providing human-like text suggestions.

- **Text Summarization:** Employ LLMs to create concise and accurate summaries of longer text documents.

- **Text Classification:** Fine-tune LLMs for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis or topic categorization.

## Usage

Explore the power of Large Language Models by following these steps:

1. **Installation:** Install the required libraries by following the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.

2. **Examples:** Review the provided [examples](examples) to see how to interact with and utilize LLMs for different NLP tasks.

## Getting Started

### Installation
